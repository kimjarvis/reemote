"""Reload the firewall with ``firewalld.reload``.

This is a *usage* example, not part of the library. It shows how an
application drives reemote5's two-phase execution model end to end over a
**real SSH transport** (asyncssh):

1. Specify the target hosts as an *inventory*: a list of dictionaries with
   each host's name plus its SSH ``connection`` information (address,
   username and client key). The hosts must run firewalld (RHEL-family);
   point ``INVENTORY`` at your own machines to target them.
2. Build the deploy script as a generator yielding ``OperationRequest``
   objects.
3. Run the prepare phase to get a plan, and the apply phase to execute it.

Unlike the pytest suite -- which injects the test framework's ``SimulatedHost``
via ``run``'s ``host_factory`` and never touches the network -- this example
uses the *default* factory (``Host.from_inventory``). Each plain ``Host``
lazily opens an asyncssh connection from its ``connection`` data, gathers
facts and runs commands for real, and ``run`` closes those connections when
it finishes. ``run`` is a coroutine, so ``main`` is async and driven by
``asyncio.run``.

``firewalld.reload`` is a reemote5 original (pyinfra ships no firewalld
module): it is the bridge between firewalld's two configurations, with
three modes -- ``reload`` (the default: apply permanent to runtime,
keeping connection state; this is what makes permanent-only creations
like new zones, service definitions and ipsets appear at runtime),
``complete_reload`` (the same but dropping all connection state -- use
only when conntrack entries must be flushed) and
``runtime_to_permanent`` (the reverse: persist the runtime configuration
to disk). An unknown mode raises ``ValueError``. Unlike every other
firewalld operation this one is **stateless**: a reload is an event, not
a state, so it always yields and always reports changed -- which is why
the script yields it *once* rather than the twice-for-idempotence
pattern the membership examples use. In a larger deploy it belongs
*after* the permanent-only changes (see
``examples/modules/firewalld/firewalld_zone.py`` for the
zone-then-reload composition); the dual-apply membership operations do
not need it.

``firewall-cmd`` writes daemon state, so the request is flagged
``sudo=True`` and the driver elevates its command over SSH.

The demo hosts ship without firewalld, so ``main`` first drives a small
idempotent *install deploy* (``dnf.packages`` + ``systemd.service`` under
``sudo=True``) to install firewalld and start/enable the daemon, then runs
the deploy below. firewalld's daemon performs the privileged kernel work,
so ``firewall-cmd`` mutations succeed even when sudo lands in a confined
SELinux domain.

Run it with::
