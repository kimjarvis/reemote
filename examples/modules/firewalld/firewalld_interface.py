"""Bind a network interface to a firewalld zone with ``firewalld.interface``.

This is a *usage* example, not part of the library. It shows how an
application drives reemote5's two-phase execution model end to end over a
**real SSH transport** (asyncssh):

1. Read ``inventory.json`` in the project root and parse it as JSON
   -- an inventory is just a list of dictionaries, which is exactly what
   JSON expresses -- then validate it up front with ``validate_inventory``
   so a malformed file fails with an ``InventoryError`` naming the
   offending entry, *before* any host is materialized or connected.
2. Build the deploy script as a generator yielding ``OperationRequest``
   objects, each guarded by a ``when`` predicate.
3. Run the prepare phase to get a plan, and the apply phase to execute it.

Unlike the pytest suite -- which injects the test framework's ``SimulatedHost``
via ``run``'s ``host_factory`` and never touches the network -- this example
uses the *default* factory (``Host.from_inventory``). Each plain ``Host``
lazily opens an asyncssh connection from its ``connection`` data, gathers
facts and runs commands for real, and ``run`` closes those connections when
it finishes. ``run`` is a coroutine, so ``main`` is async and driven by
``asyncio.run``.

``firewalld.interface`` is a reemote5 original (pyinfra ships no firewalld
module): it binds an interface to a zone -- here ``eth1`` to the built-in
``internal`` zone, the classic two-NIC split. The present direction
renders ``--change-interface``, not ``--add-interface``: an interface
lives in exactly one zone, so binding it *moves* it out of whatever zone
currently holds it (``--add-interface`` would fail on an already-bound
interface). The operation is idempotent on the ``FirewalldZones`` fact
per scope: it compares the target zone's interface list, and with the
default ``permanent=True`` dual-applies, permanent first. Note that
NetworkManager may re-assert its own connection-profile zone on the next
interface restart; for NM-managed NICs the durable binding belongs in
the connection profile. The script yields the *same* request twice: on
an unbound host the prepare phase plans both as changes, while the apply
phase rebinds on the first and reports the second as a no-op through the
fresh per-step fact cache.

``firewall-cmd`` writes daemon state, so both requests are flagged
``sudo=True`` and the driver elevates their commands over SSH. Rebinding
the interface you are connected through can drop the SSH session --
target a second NIC, as this example does.

The demo hosts ship without firewalld, so ``main`` first drives a small
idempotent *install deploy* (``dnf.packages`` + ``systemd.service`` under
``sudo=True``) to install firewalld and start/enable the daemon, then runs
the deploy below. firewalld's daemon performs the privileged kernel work,
so ``firewall-cmd`` mutations succeed even when sudo lands in a confined
SELinux domain.

Every request carries ``when=is_centos``, the declarative eligibility
guard: the predicate reads only **static** inventory data --
``host.group``, set by the ``"group"`` key of the inventory entry -- and
is a stable module-level function, so the prepare and apply phases reach
the same skip decision. The driver skips a rejected request without
materializing it, so on hosts outside the ``"centos"`` group neither the
commands nor the facts behind them run, and plan and log render the step
as ``[skipped: when guard is_centos]`` in its lockstep slot. The path is
resolved from ``__file__``, so the example works from any working
directory; point ``INVENTORY_PATH`` at your own file to target your
machines.
