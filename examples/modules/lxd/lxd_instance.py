"""Example: ensure an LXD instance on real CentOS hosts.

This is a *usage* example, not part of the library. It drives reemote5's
two-phase execution model end to end over a **real SSH transport**
(asyncssh):

1. Read ``inventory.json`` in the project root and parse it as JSON
   -- an inventory is just a list of dictionaries, which is exactly what
   JSON expresses -- then validate it up front with ``validate_inventory``
   so a malformed file fails with an ``InventoryError`` naming the
   offending entry, *before* any host is materialized or connected.
2. Build the deploy script as a generator yielding ``OperationRequest``
   objects. Every request is flagged ``sudo=True``, so the ``lxc`` client
   talks to the LXD daemon socket as root -- no password travels through
   operation arguments, plans or logs.
3. Run the prepare phase to get a plan, and the apply phase to execute it.

``lxd.instance`` is the reemote5-original successor to the baseline's
``lxd.container``. It reads the ``LxdInstances`` fact: an absent instance
yields one ``lxc launch`` carrying the type (``instance_type="vm"`` for
a virtual machine), ``profiles``, ``config`` (``"key=value"`` strings),
``devices`` (``(name, type, ("key=value", ...))`` triples) and the
creation-only ``ephemeral`` flag. An existing instance is reconciled
NON-DESTRUCTIVELY -- profiles assigned, drifted config keys set, drifted
devices removed and re-added. Base-image drift is resolved through the
``LxdImages`` fact and REPORTED in the reason only, never recreated; a
container/VM type mismatch raises ``OperationError`` (delete it first).
``present=False`` stops a running instance then deletes it.

The deploy yields the same create request twice: on a host without the
instance the second is a guaranteed no-op in the apply phase, because
the first launch is visible to it through the fresh per-step fact cache
(in the prepare phase, where nothing is sent, both plan as changes).

**Host prerequisite.** This example needs the ``lxc`` CLI and a running,
initialized LXD daemon (login user in the ``lxd`` group for fact reads;
operations ride ``sudo=True``). The demo CentOS hosts have neither: LXD is
snap-only on EL9 and their ``staff_t``-confined sudo cannot create ``/snap``
or reach ``/run/snapd.socket``, so it cannot be installed. Compile-checked
and exercised by the offline harness, not run against shared hosts; point
``INVENTORY_PATH`` at LXD-enabled machines (or relax the demo hosts) to run live.

Every request carries ``when=is_centos``, the declarative eligibility
guard: the predicate reads only **static** inventory data --
``host.group``, set by the ``"group"`` key of the inventory entry -- and
is a stable module-level function, so the prepare and apply phases reach
the same skip decision. The driver skips a rejected request without
materializing it, so on hosts outside the ``"centos"`` group neither the
commands nor the facts behind them run, and plan and log render the step
as ``[skipped: when guard is_centos]`` in its lockstep slot. The path is
resolved from ``__file__``, so the example works from any working
directory; point ``INVENTORY_PATH`` at your own file to target your
machines.

Run it with::
