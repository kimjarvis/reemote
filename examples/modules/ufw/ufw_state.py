"""Example: ensure ufw is enabled on real CentOS hosts.

This is a *usage* example, not part of the library. It drives reemote5's
two-phase execution model end to end over a **real SSH transport**
(asyncssh):

1. Read ``inventory.json`` in the project root and parse it as JSON
   -- an inventory is just a list of dictionaries, which is exactly what
   JSON expresses -- then validate it up front with ``validate_inventory``
   so a malformed file fails with an ``InventoryError`` naming the
   offending entry, *before* any host is materialized or connected.
2. Build the deploy script as a generator yielding ``OperationRequest``
   objects. Every request is flagged ``sudo=True``: ufw mutations need
   root, so the commands ride under sudo.
3. Run the prepare phase to get a plan, and the apply phase to execute it.

``ufw.state`` reads the ``UfwStatus`` fact and yields ``ufw --force
enable`` only when the firewall is currently inactive (the ``--force``
skips ufw's interactive "may disrupt existing ssh connections" prompt);
``enabled=False`` yields ``ufw disable`` only when it is active. Enabling
also turns the ufw service on at boot.

**This example is compile-checked by the test suite, not executed
against the shared demo hosts**: activating a live firewall is an
operator decision, not a demo side effect. Make sure an allow rule for
SSH (``ufw.rule(port=22, protocol="tcp")``) exists *before* enabling ufw
with a deny-incoming default, or the deploy locks itself out.

The deploy yields the same state request twice: in the prepare phase
(where nothing is sent) both plan as changes, but in the apply phase the
second request's fresh per-step fact cache sees the first enable and
reports ufw is already active.

The demo hosts ship without ufw (EPEL-only on RHEL-family), so the deploy
first installs ``epel-release`` and ``ufw`` via ``dnf.packages`` under
``sudo=True``. Installing ufw does not activate it, so the install step is
safe; the firewall mutations below remain compile-checked, not executed.

Every request carries ``when=is_centos``, the declarative eligibility
guard: the predicate reads only **static** inventory data --
``host.group``, set by the ``"group"`` key of the inventory entry -- and
is a stable module-level function, so the prepare and apply phases reach
the same skip decision. The driver skips a rejected request without
materializing it, so on hosts outside the ``"centos"`` group neither the
commands nor the facts behind them run, and plan and log render the step
as ``[skipped: when guard is_centos]`` in its lockstep slot. The path is
resolved from ``__file__``, so the example works from any working
directory; point ``INVENTORY_PATH`` at your own file to target your
machines.
