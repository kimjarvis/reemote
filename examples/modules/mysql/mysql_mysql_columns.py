"""Example: gather the ``mysql.MysqlColumns`` fact on real CentOS hosts.

This is a *usage* example, not part of the library. It reads a single
**fact** directly over the *real SSH transport* (asyncssh) instead of
driving the two-phase execution model:

1. Read ``inventory.json`` in the project root and parse it as JSON
   -- an inventory is just a list of dictionaries, which is exactly what
   JSON expresses -- then validate it up front with ``validate_inventory``
   so a malformed file fails with an ``InventoryError`` naming the
   offending entry, *before* any host is materialized or connected.
2. Materialize each entry into a plain ``Host`` with the default
   ``Host.from_inventory`` factory. Each ``Host`` lazily opens an asyncssh
   connection from its ``connection`` data when a fact is gathered.
3. Guard the gather with a ``when`` predicate: ``is_centos`` reads only
   **static** inventory data -- ``host.group`` -- and the fact is gathered
   on the hosts that pass it. ``gather_fact`` itself takes no ``when``
   parameter, so the predicate filters the host list before the fan-out --
   the direct equivalent of a driver-side skip. Hosts outside the
   ``"centos"`` group are named on a
   ``== Skipped (when guard is_centos): ... ==`` line and never connected.
4. Gather ``MysqlColumns`` for one table on the guarded hosts at once with the
   driver's ``gather_fact`` helper -- the database and table are
   positional arguments -- and print each host's column definition list
   (type, nullability, default, key, extra, comment, ordinal position)
   with ``json.dumps(..., indent=2)``.

The fact runs ``mysql -Be "SELECT ... FROM information_schema.COLUMNS
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'shop' AND TABLE_NAME = 'orders' ORDER BY
ORDINAL_POSITION"`` as the login user. Edit the database/table below to
one that exists on your hosts (the ``mysql_table.py`` operation example
creates ``shop.orders``); an absent table reads as an empty list. Keep
the credentials in a host-side ``~/.my.cnf``, or pass ``mysql_user`` /
``mysql_host`` / ``mysql_defaults_file`` to ``gather_fact`` for a TCP
login backed by an option file. No password option exists -- credentials
never travel through fact arguments.

Every host's connection is closed with ``aclose`` once the facts are
gathered. ``gather_fact`` and ``process`` are coroutines, so ``main`` is
async and driven by ``asyncio.run``.

**Host prerequisite.** This example needs a running MySQL server. The demo
CentOS hosts install and start it fine (``sudo dnf install -y mysql-server``,
``sudo systemctl start mysqld``), but their ``staff_t``-confined client
cannot reach the unix socket ``/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock`` (``ERROR 2002
... (13)`` -- SELinux denies ``staff_t`` the ``mysqld_db_t`` socket the
no-password design needs). Compile-checked and exercised by the offline
harness, not run against shared hosts; relax the demo hosts' sudo or point
``INVENTORY_PATH`` at your own MySQL machines to run live.

The path is resolved from ``__file__``, so the example works from any
working directory; point ``INVENTORY_PATH`` at your own file (or edit
``inventory.json``) to target your machines.

Run it with::

    uv run python examples/modules/mysql/mysql_mysql_columns.py
