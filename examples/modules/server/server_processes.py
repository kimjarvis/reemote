"""Example: gather the ``server.Processes`` fact on real CentOS hosts.

This is a *usage* example, not part of the library. Like
``examples/modules/server/server_mounts.py``, it reads a single **fact**
directly over the *real SSH transport* (asyncssh) instead of driving the
two-phase execution model:

1. Read ``inventory.json`` in the project root and parse it as JSON
   -- an inventory is just a list of dictionaries, which is exactly what
   JSON expresses -- then validate it up front with ``validate_inventory``
   so a malformed file fails with an ``InventoryError`` naming the
   offending entry, *before* any host is materialized or connected.
2. Materialize each entry into a plain ``Host`` with the default
   ``Host.from_inventory`` factory. Each ``Host`` lazily opens an asyncssh
   connection from its ``connection`` data when a fact is gathered.
3. Guard the gather with a ``when`` predicate: ``is_centos`` reads only
   **static** inventory data -- ``host.group`` -- and the fact is gathered
   on the hosts that pass it. ``gather_fact`` itself takes no ``when``
   parameter, so the predicate filters the host list before the fan-out --
   the direct equivalent of a driver-side skip. Hosts outside the
   ``"centos"`` group are named on a
   ``== Skipped (when guard is_centos): ... ==`` line and never connected.
4. Gather ``Processes`` on the guarded hosts at once with the driver's
   ``gather_fact`` helper -- it fans the fact's ``process`` coroutine out
   across the inventory with ``asyncio.gather`` and returns a
   host-name-keyed mapping -- then print each host's process dict with
   ``json.dumps(..., indent=2)``.

``Processes`` mirrors the baseline's ``server.Processes``: it first reads the
``Kernel`` fact and probes for BusyBox to pick its shell -- Linux lists
``ps -eo pid,user,stat,%cpu,%mem,comm,args --no-headers``, FreeBSD the
same ``ps -eo`` without ``--no-headers``, BusyBox (Alpine) the limited
``ps -o pid,user,vsz,stat,args`` columns, and Darwin runs ``ps`` twice
(``args`` last, then ``comm`` last, joined by a marker line) because
macOS truncates any non-last text column -- and returns a dict of PID ->
``{user, state, cpu_percent, mem_percent, command, args}`` dict. An
optional ``pid`` argument restricts the listing to a single process;
here the whole table is gathered, so the output shows every running
process keyed by its PID (rendered as a string by ``json.dumps``).

Every host's connection is closed with ``aclose`` once the facts are gathered.
``gather_fact`` and ``process`` are coroutines, so ``main`` is async and driven
by ``asyncio.run``.

The path is resolved from ``__file__``, so the example works from any
working directory; point ``INVENTORY_PATH`` at your own file (or edit
``inventory.json``) to target your machines.

Run it with::

    uv run python examples/modules/server/server_processes.py
